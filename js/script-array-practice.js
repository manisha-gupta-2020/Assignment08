//STEP 1 Create a string array that contains your five favorite movies. Then, use the console to display the second movie in your array.

let favMovies = ["The Mummy", "Mission Impossible", "The Polar Express","Dhoom", "Spiderman"]
console.log(`Second movie in the array is: ${favMovies[1]}`)


//STEP 2
// Declare an array called movies using the function constructor method. Add the length of 5 into the constructor. Then, assign one of your favorite movies to each index in the array until you have 5 total movies in your array. Then, use the console to display the first movie in your array.
let movies = new Array(5)
movies[0] = "The Mummy"
movies[1] = "Mission Impossible"
movies[2] = "The Polar Express"
movies[3] = "Dhoom"
movies[4] = "Spiderman"
console.log(`First movie in the array is: ${movies[0]}`)

//STEP 3
// Copy your code from step 2. Add a new movie into the 3rd position within your array. Then, use the console to display the length of the array. You should now have 6 total movies stored in the array.
let movies = new Array(5)
movies[0] = "The Mummy"
movies[1] = "Mission Impossible"
movies[2] = "The Polar Express"
movies[3] = "Dhoom"
movies[4] = "Spiderman"

movies.splice(2,0,'Batman') //starting at position 2 delete zero elements and add Batman
console.log(`length of movie array is: ${movies.length}`)

//STEP 4
// Declare an array called movies using literal notation(arrayname = []). Then, assign one of your favorite movies to each index in the array until you have 5 total movies in your array. Now, use the delete operator to remove the first movie in the array. Use the console to display the contents of the array.
let movies = ["The Mummy", "Mission Impossible", "The Polar Express","Doom", "Spiderman"]
delete movies[0];
console.log(movies)


//STEP 5
// Declare an array called movies using literal notation. Then, assign one of your favorite movies to each index in the array until you have 7 total movies in your array. Now, use a for/in loop to iterate through the array and display each movie within the console window.
let movies = ["The Mummy", "Mission Impossible", "The Polar Express","Doom", "Spiderman","Frozen", "Moana"]

for (m in movies){
    console.log(movies[m])
}

//STEP 6
// Copy the code from step 5. Now, use a for/of loop to iterate through the array and display each movie within the console window.
let movies = ["The Mummy", "Mission Impossible", "The Polar Express","Doom", "Spiderman","Frozen", "Moana"]

for (m of movies){
    console.log(m)
}


//STEP 7
// Copy the code from step 5. Using the for/of loop to iterate through the array, display each movie within the console window in a sorted view.

let movies = ["The Mummy", "Mission Impossible", "The Polar Express","Doom", "Spiderman","Frozen", "Moana"]

for (m of movies.sort()){
    console.log(m)
}


//STEP 8

let movies = ["The Mummy", "Mission Impossible", "The Polar Express","Doom", "Spiderman","Frozen", "Moana"]
let leastFavMovies = ["Doom","Haunted House","Maniac"]
console.log(` Movies I like: \n`)
for (m in movies){
    console.log(` ${movies[m]}`)
}
console.log(` Movies I regret watching: \n`)
for (mov in leastFavMovies){
    console.log(` ${leastFavMovies[mov]}`)
}

//STEP 9
// Copy the code from step 8. Now, use the concat() method to merge the two arrays together into a single array called movies. Use the console window to display the list in reverse sorted
//console.log(movies.sort().reverse()) //first sort then reverse


// let movies = ["The Mummy", "Mission Impossible", "The Polar Express","Doom", "Spiderman","Frozen", "Moana"]
// let leastFavMovies = ["Doom","Haunted House","Maniac"]
// movies.concat(leastFavMovies)
// console.log(movies.reverse().sort()) // first reverse then sort


//STEP 10
// Copy the code from step 9. Use an array function to return just the last item in the array and display it within the console window.
// let lItem = movies.pop() //pop will return the last item but delete it as well so use slice

// let movies = ["The Mummy", "Mission Impossible", "The Polar Express","Doom", "Spiderman","Frozen", "Moana"]
// let leastFavMovies = ["Doom","Haunted House","Maniac"]
// movies.concat(leastFavMovies)
// console.log(movies.reverse().sort()) // first reverse then sort
// let lastItem = movies.slice(-1) //will slice the last element
// console.log(lastItem)



//STEP 11
// Copy the code from step 10. Remove the previous method and this time use a method to return just the first item in the array and display it within the console window.

// let movies = ["The Mummy", "Mission Impossible", "The Polar Express","Doom", "Spiderman","Frozen", "Moana"];
// let leastFavMovies = ["Doom","Haunted House","Maniac"]
// movies.concat(leastFavMovies)
// console.log(movies.reverse().sort()) // first reverse then sort
// let firstItem = movies.slice(0,1)
// console.log(firstItem)

//STEP 12
// Programmatically retrieve the movies in your array that you do not like and return their indices. Then, using those indices, programmatically add movies that you do like.

let movies = ["The Mummy", "Mission Impossible", "The Polar Express","Doom", "Spiderman","Frozen", "Moana"];
let newFavMovies = ['Star wars','Downtown Abbey','Magic Horse']
let indiceList = [];
// loop and stores indices of not liked movie in array. 
movies.forEach(movie => {
    if (movie == "Doom" || movie == "Spiderman" ){
        indiceList.push(movies.indexOf(movie))
    }
})
// console.log('indice list is: ' + indiceList) // print indices to check result
//loop thru the indice list and asign values to the items from another array.
for(let i=0; i < indiceList.length; i++){
    // console.log(`indice list : ${indiceList[i]} and ${newFavMovies[i]}`)
    movies[indiceList[i]] = newFavMovies[i];
}

console.log(movies)


//STEP 13
// Create a multi-dimensional array that contains your 5 favorite movies and their ranking from 1-5. The array should look something like this:

// movies = [["Movie 1", 1], ["Movie 2", 2], ["Movie 3", 3], ["Movie 4", 4], ["Movie 5", 5]];

// Now, loop through the array and filter out and display only the movie names. You must use the filter() method and youâ€™ll need to filter out the names by their primitive data type.

let movies = [["The Mummy",1], ["Mission Impossible",2], ["The Polar Express",3],["Frozen",4], ["Moana",5]];
let movieNames = ['test']
movies.forEach(movie => {
    // console.log(movie) // movie is the array element in multidimensional array
    let movieName = movie.filter(item => {
        console.log(item)
        return typeof(item) === "string"    // return item from array element if it is a string
    })
    movieNames = movieNames.concat(movieName)    
    })
console.log(movieNames)


//STEP 14
/*
Create a string array called employees using literal notation and populate the array with several employee names. Then, create an anonymous function called showEmployee. The function should accept a parameter. Call this function, passing in the employees array into the function as a parameter. Make sure to display the result in the console window. Within the function, loop through the passed in array and display the result so that it looks exactly like this in the console window:

ZAK
JESSICA
MARK
FRED
SALLY
